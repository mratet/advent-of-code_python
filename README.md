# advent-of-code_python

This repository contains all my solution for advent of code problems. I'm trying to refactor them so that they are understandable and relatively effective for my input (< 1s).

# Setup

My setup is mostly inspired from [hyper-neutrino](https://github.com/hyper-neutrino/advent-of-code).
I use ```python start.py dd --year yyyy``` to download my input using [advent-of-code-data](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data) and create an empty file. Then, I use 'aos' or 'aot' to run my solution on my input / test file.
